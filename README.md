This app records the summary of the conversation between a doctor and patient . 
It extracts the keywords like patient name, age, diagnosis, prescribed medicines, dosage, advice etc using NLP which is implemented by a DialogFlow API.
The app also provides the doctor with an editing option so he can make any changes to the words he said.
Finally a documented PDF will be send to the patient regarding the summary through mail and SMS.
